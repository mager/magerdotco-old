summary: "I decided to change the look and feel of the site."

I just deployed a new version of this site that uses a <a href="https://github.com/cakebatterandsprinkles/portfolio-gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby theme</a> based the design & development work of <a href="https://yagmurcetintas.com/" target="_blank">Yagmur Cetin Tas</a>.

I tweaked a few things but generally kept it the same. I'm hoping to do more updates and might completely redesign again, but I much prefer this look over the last design.

Massive shoutout to Yagmur... the code is beautiful. Also, I'm reallly enjoying her blog, especially her introductions to <a href="https://yagmurcetintas.com/journal/introduction-to-docker" target="_blank">Docker</a>, <a href="https://yagmurcetintas.com/journal/introduction-to-typescript" target="_blank">Typescript</a>, and <a href="https://yagmurcetintas.com/journal/introduction-to-redis" target="_blank">Redis</a>.

Stay tuned for more updates!
